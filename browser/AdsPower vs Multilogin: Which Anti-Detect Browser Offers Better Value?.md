## Industry Recognition for Anti-Detect Browsers

Recently, Conversion Club conducted a “Best Fingerprint Browser” nomination, recognizing **AdsPower**, **Dolphin**, and **Multilogin** as top contenders in the market. These browsers are renowned for their professional-grade fingerprinting solutions and advanced features.

## Part 1: Product Security

Both **AdsPower** and **Multilogin** excel in ensuring user data security. These anti-detect browsers:

- Offer both Chromium (Google) and Firefox-based cores, ensuring multi-kernel functionality.
- Protect user data with advanced encryption, ensuring that only the user has access to sensitive information.
- Successfully pass all fingerprint detection tests across major fingerprinting websites.

While both platforms prioritize security, **AdsPower** provides a more user-friendly interface and smoother functionality, giving it a slight edge in user experience.

## Part 2: Usability and Features

### 1. Batch Account Management

Managing hundreds or thousands of accounts is a common requirement for cross-border e-commerce and digital marketing. **AdsPower** offers robust tools for batch management, including:

- Account filtering, exporting, moving, and sharing
- Bulk edits for account notes, labels, and information updates
- Streamlined workflows for account automation

In comparison, **Multilogin** offers limited batch management capabilities, such as group creation, profile deletion, and exports. For efficient account management, **AdsPower** is the superior choice.

### 2. Automation Tools

Automation is essential for scaling account operations. **AdsPower** leads in this area with:

- Comprehensive browser automation tools, including **Facebook-specific automation (FB Auto)**, highly praised by users.
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) with pre-built templates, a template marketplace, and custom automation flows for repetitive tasks.
- API integration to manage configurations, start/stop browsers, and automate processes.

Meanwhile, **Multilogin** provides basic automation features like **CookieRobot**, which can perform simple browsing and click actions. However, Multilogin's automation lacks the flexibility of AdsPower, and its API integration requires advanced programming knowledge, making it less accessible for beginners.

### 3. Recycle Bin Functionality

AdsPower includes a **recycle bin feature** that allows users to restore environments deleted within the last seven days, adding a safety net for accidental deletions. Unfortunately, **Multilogin** does not offer a similar feature—deleted environments are permanently lost.

## Part 3: Pricing and Flexibility

### AdsPower Pricing

- Paid plans start at **$9/month**, with discounts for quarterly (5%), semi-annual (10%), and annual (20%) payments.
- Flexible packages based on the number of environments and login members, ensuring no wasted resources.

### Multilogin Pricing
- No free trial is available—users must purchase a plan to test features.
- Paid plans start at **€99/month (approximately $108)**, making it one of the most expensive anti-detect browsers in the market.
- Plans lack flexibility, with rigid pricing structures unsuitable for small teams or individual users.

In terms of affordability and flexibility, **AdsPower** offers significantly better value than Multilogin.
