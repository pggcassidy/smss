## What Is Ghostbrowser?

Launched in 2016, Ghostbrowser is designed to help users manage multiple online accounts while ensuring privacy and anonymity. It offers features such as:

### Key Features of Ghostbrowser
Here’s what Ghostbrowser brings to the table:

1. **Advanced Session Management**  
   Ghostbrowser allows users to open tabs in isolated “Sessions,” each with unique cookies and cache. This is ideal for managing multiple accounts securely, but it lacks custom browser fingerprint generation, limiting its use for advanced tasks.

2. **Proxy Integration**  
   Ghostbrowser enables users to assign different proxies to individual sessions, adding a layer of anonymity. However, it doesn’t provide built-in proxies, requiring users to source their own.

3. **Workspace Customization**  
   Users can save and reopen specific session setups, improving workflow consistency for recurring projects.

4. **Chrome Extension Compatibility**  
   As a Chromium-based browser, Ghostbrowser supports Chrome extensions, allowing users to enhance their browsing experience with ad blockers, SEO plugins, and more.

5. **Basic Security Features**  
   Ghostbrowser includes encrypted profile storage and two-factor authentication (2FA). However, these features are relatively standard and may not meet the needs of users requiring advanced anti-detection capabilities.
