![Proxy features](https://multilogin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/illustration.png)

## Built-in Proxies

**Multilogin** provides built-in residential proxies with access to over 5 million IPs across 195+ countries. Key features include super-sticky IP sessions for up to 24 hours, bandwidth rollover, and an IP quality filter for superior geographic coverage and performance.

In contrast, **Dolphin Anty** supports proxy protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and Socks5 but does not offer built-in proxies.

---

## Web Automation

**Multilogin** stands out in high-load automation, supporting thousands of accounts with features like automated logins, CAPTCHA bypass, and browser fingerprint customization. It integrates with Selenium, Playwright, and Puppeteer for large-scale automation.

**Dolphin Anty**, while offering script support and integration with Selenium and Playwright, lacks Puppeteer compatibility and strong automation detection prevention, making it less reliable for automation-heavy tasks.

---

## Advanced Fingerprinting Customization

**Multilogin** offers comprehensive anti-fingerprinting, including features for canvas, WebGL, geolocation, timezone, and language. Its unique browsers, Stealthfox and Mimic, provide robust protection. Additional tools like Active Session Lock, Google Services integration, Custom DNS, and port scan protection ensure unparalleled security and anonymity.

**Dolphin Anty** falls short in fingerprinting, lacking features like font substitution, audio hardware noise customization, and complete profile management, which limits its effectiveness in concealing digital footprints.

---

## Data Privacy & Security

**Multilogin**, based in Europe, adheres to GDPR standards, deleting user data three months post-subscription. Passwords are hashed, account data encrypted using AES, and cloud-stored sessions are fully protected. This ensures end-to-end security.

**Dolphin Anty**, on the other hand, faced a major data breach in July 2022, affecting 15% of users. Although improvements have been made, its security track record raises concerns compared to Multilogin's solid reputation.

---

## Customer Support

**Multilogin** provides 24/7 customer support via live chat, email, and Telegram, with assistance available in five languages: English, Vietnamese, Russian, Chinese, and Portuguese. Its Knowledge Center includes extensive guides and resources.

**Dolphin Anty** offers global support but primarily caters to Russian speakers. Response times are slower, and its blog and guides lack the depth needed for comprehensive support.
